# Inspiration Generator

As a personal project, this mini app serves two purposes. First, it is a way of getting inspired to create something visual, such as a character or prop. Second, it provides coding practice with an example project that falls within the context of visual narrative.

## Visual Insipration
The initial version of this single page app is meant to mimic brainstorming towards a character design by combining two words that may not necessarily go together. Imagine filling two bowls with slips of paper and pulling one piece of paper out of each to see what you got. 

This iteration uses what I call a "verbing" and a "whats-it". A "verbing" is simply a verb in action, like "harmonizing" or "gargling". A "whats-it" is the thing doing the action, such as a "mouse" or a "cactus" (it can also be made up of two words, like "corn cob"). There are currently about 90 options for each.

Future iterations will include an adjective or quality. Another possibility is to make what is mixed together be visual, such as eyes (top of head), nose (middle of head) and mouth (bottom of head). 

## Functionality
The basic functionality is to click the button that says "Create". This randomly grabs the two words, one from each list, and displays them. Clicking the "Keep" button adds that combination to a Combos list and removes those as options from the respective lists. Clicking "Create" does not affect the lists, it simply grabs two new words. The Combos list can be shown or hidden. Clicking the "Restart" button resets both lists and empties the Combos list.

Future iterations plan to flesh out the presentation, and clarify what the app does exactly. The word-based version might offer the chance for the user to add in their own "verbing" or "whats-it" words and work with those. They might also be able to keep one word and discard the other if they feel one isn't constructive. Currently you either keep or discard both words.

This is a work in progress...
